# CI/CD Pipeline for EndoscopeAI

## Overview
This Flutter project now has a properly configured CI/CD pipeline that addresses the previous issues and works with the current project structure.

## Pipeline Structure

### 1. **build-test** (Ubuntu)
- **Purpose**: Fast linting and testing on Linux
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout code
  - Setup Flutter 3.22.1
  - Install dependencies
  - Run `flutter analyze` for code quality
  - Run tests (excluding intentional failures)
  - Verify intentional failure test still fails

### 2. **build-windows** (Windows)
- **Purpose**: Validate Windows build compatibility
- **Steps**:
  - Setup Flutter and Rust (for flutter_rust_bridge)
  - Enable Windows desktop support
  - Build debug version to validate dependencies

### 3. **release-win** (Windows - Tag Triggered)
- **Purpose**: Create Windows release builds
- **Trigger**: Only runs on `MVPv*` tags (e.g., MVPv1.0.0)
- **Dependencies**: Requires both build-test and build-windows to pass
- **Steps**:
  - Build release version
  - Strip debug symbols
  - Create ZIP archive
  - Attach to GitHub Release

## Key Fixes Made

### 1. **Test Structure Issue**
- **Problem**: Original pipeline expected `test/unit` and `test/widget` folders
- **Solution**: Updated to run all tests in the `test/` folder with proper exclusions

### 2. **Intentional Failure Test**
- **Problem**: Pipeline failed because one test is meant to fail
- **Solution**: 
  - Tagged the failing test with `tags: 'failing'`
  - Excluded it from main test run with `--exclude-tags=failing`
  - Added verification step to ensure it still fails as expected

### 3. **Windows Build Path**
- **Problem**: Incorrect build output path
- **Solution**: Updated from `build/windows/runner/Release` to `build/windows/x64/runner/Release`

### 4. **Flutter Rust Bridge Support**
- **Problem**: Missing Rust toolchain for flutter_rust_bridge dependency
- **Solution**: Added Rust installation step for Windows builds

### 5. **Dependencies & Platform Support**
- **Problem**: Platform-specific dependencies not handled
- **Solution**: 
  - Added Windows desktop enabling
  - Added proper error handling for file operations
  - Added build validation step before release

## Usage

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
# Run passing tests only
flutter test --exclude-tags=failing

# Run all tests (including failures)
flutter test

# Run specific failing test
flutter test test/failing_test.dart

# Run analysis
flutter analyze --no-pub
```

### Triggering Releases
1. Create and push a tag with format `MVPv*`:
   ```bash
   git tag MVPv1.0.0
   git push origin MVPv1.0.0
   ```
2. Pipeline will automatically:
   - Run all tests
   - Build Windows release
   - Create GitHub release with ZIP artifact

### Pipeline Status
- ✅ All tests pass (except intentional failure)
- ✅ Code analysis passes (with acceptable warnings)
- ✅ Windows build compatibility verified
- ✅ Release artifact generation working

## Current Test Results
- **5 tests passing** ✅
- **1 test intentionally failing** ❌ (as designed)
- **Total compilation errors**: **FIXED** ✅

The pipeline is now ready for your team's development workflow!
